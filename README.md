# CiiCube
This repository contains the code used when studying the CiiCube algorithm.

An article is going to be published on CiiCube.
Since the article is being reviewed and I am not sure if I can publish it on here, if anyone wants an early version of it just send me a message. That being said, the interneship theses contains all the results and conclusions obtained, although it is witten in portuguese. The interneship theses can be found [in this link](https://github.com/Blaldas/Internship-Data-Cube-ID-Reduction/blob/main/MarcoDomingues_2018013362_RelatoÃÅrioEstagio.pdf).

The full code with all the different versions created and Frag-Cubing used to compare the results can be found [here](https://github.com/Blaldas/Internship-Data-Cube-ID-Reduction).
